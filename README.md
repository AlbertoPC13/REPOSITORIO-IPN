# REPOSITORIO IPN
Project developed for the Hackaton 2021 hosted by the Programming Club from ESFM - IPN. It's a web system that allows the IPN community to upload academic resources to help in the learning process during the pandemic.
 
The project was developed by an interdisciplinary team of 5 members and allowed us to be finalists in the contest.
